# Youtube Video Analysis

## Overview
* In this exciting YouTube Video Analysis project, we dive into the world of data and Python to uncover valuable insights from the vast
and dynamic universe of YouTube videos.
* YouTube is the second-largest search engine and a goldmine of diverse content, making it an excellent platform for data analysis.
* In this project we use Python's powerful libraries and techniques to process, and visualize YouTube video data. By the end of the
project, we will have a comprehensive understanding of data analysis and how it can be applied to derive meaningful information
from online media.

## Installation
* The entire Code is written in Python 3.11.0 using Anaconda and jupyter notebook.
**Requirements**
* Anaconda
* Jupyter notebook of version 6.5.4
* Python 3.11.0

**Ensuring you have the latest version of conda.** 
* To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository.

```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```


## Key highlights of the project include:

**Data Collection:** The dataset for the project is taken from Kaggle.
**link**: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/apolynomialcurve/youtube-trending-page-analytics/input?select=IN_youtube_trending_data.csv">Dataset</a>

**Data Preprocessing:** Discover the significance of data preprocessing and cleansing to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis.
We'll cover techniques like handling missing data, converting data types, and dealing with duplicates etc..

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We'll create insightful visualizations to gain a better understanding of the dataset.

**Note:** Prior knowledge of Python programming is recommended for a better understanding of this project concepts.
